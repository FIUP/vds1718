{
	Assume that the language $\textbf{While}^{\textbf{+}}$ includes a new
	iterative command
	\begin{center}
	\repeatSbS{$S_1$}{$b$}{$S_2$}
	\end{center}
	where $b~\in~\bexp$ and $S_1,~S_2~\in~\stm$, whose informal semantics goes
	as follows:\\The following three steps are iteratively executed:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item the command $S_1$ is executed
	\item the Boolean expression $b$ is evaluated; if $b$ evaluates to 
	\emph{false} then the loop is exited, otherwise the loop proceeds with step
	3
	\item command $S_2$ is executed
	\end{enumerate}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item [(a)] Define the small step operational semantics of this new
	iterative command.
	\item [(b)] Find a program \textbf{P} in the basic language \textbf{While} such that
	\begin{center}
	$\repeatSbS{$S_1$}{$b$}{$S_2$}~\cong_{sos}~P$
	\end{center}
	and formally prove this semantic equivalence.
	\end{itemize}
